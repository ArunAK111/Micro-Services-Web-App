# Micro-Services Web App

## Overview

This repository showcases the transformation of an e-commerce platform from a monolithic architecture to a microservices-based architecture using the MERN stack. The application was initially built as a single, unified codebase and has now been divided into four distinct, scalable microservices, each encapsulated in Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes. This enhances scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility.

## Microservices Description

- **Frontend Service**: Manages the user interface and interaction.
- **User Service (UC1)**: Handles user authentication and profile management.
- **Product Service (UC2)**: Manages product inventory, descriptions, and details.
- **Order Service (UC3)**: Processes and tracks orders.

## Technologies Used

- **CI/CD**: For continuous integration and continuous deployment, enhancing the software delivery process.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing all application data.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework used within Node.js.
- **React.js**: Library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for executing the backend in JavaScript.
- **Docker**: For containerizing each microservice.
- **Kubernetes**: For automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers.
